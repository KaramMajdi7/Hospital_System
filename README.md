# Hospital_System

This project was created using Java OOP programming, and using the JavaFX library, and by including the OOP concepts like : 
(first Inheritance that shows the hierarchical relationship between classes and objects, and also 
Abstraction is the principle that allows to express only main features and hiding the details from the user).

And also before creating the program I started using the software engineering concepts and I made a diagram and desings,
to create the program, and I used associations and notes and class names and annotation for association.

And the project is not the best in the design and colors but it's the best I could do using only the JavaFX
library without and database or and other library, so if we look at the interface and access the patient section first
we will have this as the first scene:

And then we will press on the patient section and this will be displayed:

And then we will complete the information it needs to continue:

And at last if we press the done button it will take us to the last page with the information you filled:

And I hope someday that the program will be developed and changed to a better way than this because this was my first program to do 
and it was like 2 years ago, and it helped me in developing and understanding the OOP concepts and software engineering concepts.
