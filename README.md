# Hospital_System

This project was created using Java OOP programming, and using the JavaFX library, and by including the OOP concepts like : 
(first Inheritance that shows the hierarchical relationship between classes and objects, and also 
Abstraction is the principle that allows to express only main features and hiding the details from the user).

And also before creating the program I started using the software engineering concepts and I made a diagram and desings,
to create the program, and I used associations and notes and class names and annotation for association.
